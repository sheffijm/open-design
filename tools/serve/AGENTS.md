# tools/serve

Follow the root `AGENTS.md` and `tools/AGENTS.md` first. This tool owns small local-development service entrypoints.

## Owns

- `tools-serve` CLI.
- Local static updater fixtures for desktop update IPC and packaged-runtime debugging.
- `resource-hub` fixture — a self-contained, in-memory stand-in for the Spec E
  resource storage service (see below).

## Rules

- Keep services self-contained and local-first.
- Do not put product update runtime logic here; this tool serves deterministic fixtures only.
- New services should use explicit subcommands under `tools-serve start <service>`.

## resource-hub fixture (TEMPORARY)

An infra-free, in-memory local backend for the daemon's Spec E resource
features. Lets you develop against the resource API without standing up the real
vela stack (services/api + postgres + MinIO). It faithfully implements the same
wire contract (endpoints, error codes, `x-internal-token` + `x-workspace-*`
auth, freeze, cross-team isolation, content-addressed dedup, presigned-style
blob transport served from the same process).

Run it, then point the daemon at it:

```
pnpm tools-serve start resource-hub --port 18090
# then, for the daemon / od CLI:
export OD_RESOURCE_HUB_URL=http://localhost:18090
export OD_RESOURCE_HUB_TOKEN=dev-internal-token
export OD_WORKSPACE_MEMBER_ID=you OD_WORKSPACE_TEAM_ID=your-team OD_WORKSPACE_ROLE=owner
od resource put ./some-dir --kind design_system --ref latest
od resource get <resource-id> ./dest
```

- **The daemon makes no mock concessions** — it runs its real client/SDK against
  this exactly as it would against vela. The fixture is the only "fake" piece.
- **This is disposable.** Once the vela test environment is stood up, delete
  `src/resource-hub-fixture.ts` (and its wiring in `src/index.ts`) and repoint
  `OD_RESOURCE_HUB_URL` at the real test API. The daemon needs zero code changes.
- **Keep the contract in sync** with `services/api/src/resources/routes.ts` in
  the vela repo — change one, mirror the other. `tests/resource-hub-fixture.test.ts`
  locks the fixture's half of the contract.
